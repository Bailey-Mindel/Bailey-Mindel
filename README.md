Hello my names Bailey-Mindel
I am completing the google data analytics course on Coursera, currently on the case study.
I am interested in becoming a data analyist. trying to line up a job for the start of 2024.

I have strong analytical thinking skills as well as excellent research and trouble shooting skills that I use everyday at my job. 
Sufficient knowledge in Excel, SQL and Tableau I've learned from googles data analytics course, and I know how to work well in groups from years of playing team sports and having to do countless colaborative projects in high-school and trades school.

I currently work at a tree nursery full-time to make ends meet, but I want a job that can further my career as a data analyst and refine my skills, as I am still new to data analytics. 

Best way to reach me is throught email; @baileymindel@gmail.com

I am taking all sorts of criticism across any platform I am on. all comments will be appreciated, I am trying to make the best impression I can in the community of data and for furture employers.
